						<h2>Background:</h2>
						<p>
							In spite of political unrest, refugee camp community leaders, teachers, parents, and youth have pushed for the continuation of education as a source of stability, hope, and as a long term investment towards a better future. The Institute of Higher Education (IHE) of the Department of Higher Education (DHE), a branch of the Karen Refugee Committee Education Entity (KRCE), have established five higher education institutions in five different refugee camps on the Thai-Burmese border: 
						</p>
						<p>
							The Northern Karen Junior College (NKJC)
						</p>
						<p>
							The Pu Taw Memorial Junior College (PTMJC)
						</p>
						<p>
							The Kaw Lah Junior College (KLJC)
						</p>
						<p>
							The Tanawthari Junior College (TJC)
						</p>
						<p>
							The Mae Ra Moe Junior College (MRMJC). 
						</p>
						<p>Over the last 13 years, there have been 2,665 graduates. Through their education, these refugee and migrant youth have been empowered with the skills they need to make a difference within their community. </p>
						<p>Graduates of these schools take a path in the field of education, health, or serve in leadership positions within the refugee camps or in their respective states in Burma. Additionally, students are able to financially support their families and be more self-sufficient rather than solely rely on food rations and donations handed out by NGOs. </p>
						<p>Each school offers either the lower division program, upper division program, or both. The lower division program utilizes a two year general studies curriculum, while the upper division program allows students to specialize in a field of their choice: public health, education, or community management. </p>
					</div>

					<div id="northern" class="main-container">
						<h2>Northern Karen Junior College (NKJC)</h2>
						<p>
