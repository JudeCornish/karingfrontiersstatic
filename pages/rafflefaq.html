							<h3>Seeker, 2013 (60x60cm, Oil on Canvas) by Marc Standing (x1)</h3>
							<p>Donated by Karen Taylor</p>
							<h4>About the artist:</h4>
								<p>Born in Zimbabwe in 1976, Marc obtained a Bachelor of Fine Arts Honors Degree from the University of Cape Town in South Africa. After emigrating to Australia in 2005, he is now currently based in Hong Kong. Marc has exhibited in New York, London, Holland, Hong Kong, South Africa and Zimbabwe, and has been included in prominent Australian art prizes, as well as being commissioned by The Groucho Club in London. He was also a nominee for the Sovereign Asian Art Prize and acquired by Artbank in Australia.</p>
							<h4>About 'Seeker':</h4>
								<p>“In ‘Seeker’, there is a play on the duality of what is hidden and what is apparent. On closer inspection, a masked figure penetrates the colourful array of birds, butterflies and orbs, which are reminiscent of natural organic forms. The hooded form represents a body silenced, confined, bound, and in a state of restraint. In juxtaposition, the birds become a symbol of freedom, flight and migration. Amongst these elements, the branches and lines in the painting morph into metaphorical topographies of our universe, perpetuating a presence of claustrophobia and entwinement. Overall the work can be interpreted as an allegory relating to human slavery, an act of aggression that at times occurs in front of our eyes without us even realising it.”</p>

							<h3>061 MAN, My face hit your fist, 2015 (30x50cm, Acrylic on paper) by Chi Loy Man (x1)</h3>
							<p>Donated by Karen Taylor</p>
							<h4>About the work:</h4>
							<p>“Conflicts may occur when people misunderstand each other. In my opinion, human rights involves understanding, respect and a sense of humour. We need to accept that each individual may think differently, and at the same time, we need to respect that distinction. A sense of humour is needed most when conflicts are ongoing and cannot be solved immediately”.</p>
							<h4>About the artist:</h4>
								<p>Chi Loy Man was born and raised in Hong Kong, but moved to the USA in the 1990s. He graduated with a BA in Studio Art from UC Davis and returned to Hong Kong in 1998.Chi Loy’s art statement is “Look for decent people in cramped environments and the future of ME”. He is curious as to how living spaces affect people’s thinking, having lived himself in vast areas in the USA and cramped spaces in Hong Kong.</p>

							<h3>Photobook Bundle of “Vertical Horizon” by Romain Jacquet-Lagreze and Living History: Bound Feet Women of China by Jo Farrell (x5)
							</h3>
							<h4>About Romain Jacquet-Lagreze</h4>
							<p>Romain Jacquet-Lagrèze was born in Paris in 1987. He graduated with a Masters in Creative Media at the East Paris University. He moved to Hong Kong in 2009 and since 2010 he has been pointing his camera at Hong Kong to document the different aspects of his new home city.
							</p>
							<p>Stunned by the architectural race to the sky and the three dimensional character of Hong Kong, he published his first book with Asia One: ‘Vertical Horizon’ (p. 2012). The work was a hit on social media and soon after spread like wildfire over the internet world-wide and received attention from heavyweight local and international press.
							</p>
							<p>Motivated by the international bravo he continued to make new projects exploring Hong Kong’s unique landscape. Wild Concrete (p. 2014) depicts nature’s resilience in an urban environment. The Blue Moment (p. 2016) is a body of work exploring the duality of Hong Kong’s nature and urbanity during this magic hour at dusk. While Concrete Stories (p. 2018) collects a variety of human activities found on Hong Kong’s rooftops.
							</p>
							<p>Romain is still focusing on evolving his photography in Hong Kong where he resides and finds inspiration.

							<h4>About Jo Farrell</h4>
							<p>Jo Farrell has devoted herself since 2005, to tracking down the last surviving Chinese women to have had their feet bound. Footbinding (also known as ‘lotus feet’) was the Chinese custom of applying painfully tight binding to the feet of young girls to prevent further growth, resulting in drastically altering the bone structure of the feet to reach a target petiteness. BOUND by the award winning artist Jo Farrell merges the educational, the anthropological, the taboo, the social and the artistic, by showcasing a focused body of research on the practice of foot binding in China. A passion project already well recognised having gone viral in 2014 in world media.</p>

							<h3>Painted Robe (29.55x42cm) by Rachel Smith - senselessart (x1)
							</h3>
							<h4>About the work:</h4>
							<p>The piece is an art quality print of a watercolour painting. 
							</p>
							<h4>About the artist:</h4>
								<p>
									The first time I saw a Qing dynasty dragon robe in a travelling museum exhibition, I fell in love. The rulers clearly took advantage of the talents of their subjects and had them produce beautiful piece to clothe the emperor and his family. Painstaking goldwork shimmered on silks and in the centre of everything was the dragon. In many cases, every piece of available space was filled in with symbolic objects but my eye was always drawn back to the four toed dragon. As I lack skill with a needle, I decided to reproduce the luminosity of the thread with paint. This was one of the first and largest paintings I have done, a half life size reproduction of a black robe featuring 9 dragons. Website: https://www.senselessart.net/. Instagram: @senselessart

							<h3>Sham Shui Po District by Serena Chan - Zone A Gallery (x1)
							</h3>
							<h4>About the artist:</h4>
							<p>Serena S.Y. Chan was born and raised in HK. After graduated from the University of
								Toronto, she worked as a registered architect internationally in cities like Toronto,
								Paris, Suhl, London, New York, and Hong Kong for many years.
								</p>
								<p>She has been a keen photographer since the age of 16 when her father gave her an
									old camera. She got honors in her photography studies while in university and in
									2010 started Zone-A Gallery and Zone A Studio.
									</p>
							<p>Her photography is about the seeing eye, that captures the fleeting moments in life,
								the moods and the emotions, the beauty, and the truth.
								</p>
							<p>Serena lived in the district of Shum Shui Po until she was 5. Her childhood memories
								of the area is like a classic black and white movie in her mind. Since her return to
								Hong Kong in 2005, she has been a frequent visitor to the district because of its
								industrial setting, the surviving garment, textile and craft industry in the area, the
								street markets, the computer, electronics and tools, toys, and the eateries, it is the
								core and foundation stone of what Hong Kong was. As a creative person, she
								sauntered through Shum Shui Po with her kids many Saturday and Sunday
								afternoon there treasures hunting, and it is an endless surprise of what can be found
								there.
								</p>
								<h4>About the work:</h4>
								<p>In this photo, it captured a washed-out glory of the old Shum Shui Po when the
									garment, textile industry was the backbone of jobs and livelihood for a lot of people
									of Hong Kong. It is even more interesting that it has been re-discovered by a lot of
									young people who move to this district to do their entrepreneurial, startup business
									adventures lately. Soon, it will be gentrified, and it is uncertain whether this is good
									news or bad news….

							<h3>Behind the Pat Sin Leng. Sam A Wan, Double Haven. (40 x 28cm, matted on foamboard.) by Guy Nowell (x1)
							</h3>
							<h4>About the work:</h4>
							<p>The photo was shot in Double Haven (Yan Chau Tong). Looking into the mouth of Sam A Wan, and the hills in the background are the north side of the Pat Sin Leng - count from the left and the first eight peaks on the ridge are the eight pilgrims.This is an image from a book we published in 2019, Cruising Hong Kong, which was the first ‘watery’ guide to Hong Kong in more than 40 years. My wife, Suzy Rayment, and I spent a lot of time afloat re-exploring the beautiful coastline and anchorages that we have visited so many times before. A second edition of the book will be published in June - the first edition sold out.
							</p>
							<h4>About Guy Nowell:
							</h4>
								<p>I have been a professional photographer since 1988. Before that I worked in a bank. I am also a sailor, and I love to combine sailing and photography. Before Covid and lockdowns everywhere, I spent a lot of time every year covering the major sailing regattas all over Asia - principally Hong Kong, Thailand, and Malaysia. But that’s all stopped at the moment, so I have been spending more time recording the natural landscapes - and especially the coastlines - here at home in Hong Kong.

							<h3>Counter Culture by Marcel Heijnen (x1)



							</h3>
							</p>
							<h4>About the Work:

							</h4>
								<p>This work titled ‘Counter Culture’ featured the wonderfully chilled cat Dau Ding and his servant in a Sai Ying Pun dried goods and medicine store. He was the first shop cat I spotted back in 2015 and therefore the trigger of what became the Chinese Whiskers series that resulted in the Hong Kong Shop Cats book that has enjoyed worldwide attention and is currently in its 6th print edition.

								</p>
								<h4>About Simon Fuller:</h4>

Marcel’s creativity is driven by a general curiosity about life and its meaning. He currently uses photography as the main medium for his art, exploring its boundaries in a quest for beauty and expression that goes beyond realism, but gets perhaps a little closer to truth.

He is represented by Eduard Planting Gallery in Amsterdam and Artyze and Amanda Wei Gallery in Hong Kong. Marcel has published 5 photo books to date and has been signed by the British art book publisher Thames & Hudson for 2 more books to be released this year. Website: www.marcelheijnen.com.
