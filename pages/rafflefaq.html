							<h3>Seeker, 2013 (60x60cm, Oil on Canvas) by Marc Standing</h3>
							<h4>About the artist:</h4>
								<p>Born in Zimbabwe in 1976, Marc obtained a Bachelor of Fine Arts Honors Degree from the University of Cape Town in South Africa. After emigrating to Australia in 2005, he is now currently based in Hong Kong. Marc has exhibited in New York, London, Holland, Hong Kong, South Africa and Zimbabwe, and has been included in prominent Australian art prizes, as well as being commissioned by The Groucho Club in London. He was also a nominee for the Sovereign Asian Art Prize and acquired by Artbank in Australia.</p>
							<h4>About 'Seeker':</h4>
								<p>“In ‘Seeker’, there is a play on the duality of what is hidden and what is apparent. On closer inspection, a masked figure penetrates the colourful array of birds, butterflies and orbs, which are reminiscent of natural organic forms. The hooded form represents a body silenced, confined, bound, and in a state of restraint. In juxtaposition, the birds become a symbol of freedom, flight and migration. Amongst these elements, the branches and lines in the painting morph into metaphorical topographies of our universe, perpetuating a presence of claustrophobia and entwinement. Overall the work can be interpreted as an allegory relating to human slavery, an act of aggression that at times occurs in front of our eyes without us even realising it.”</p>

							<h3>061 MAN, My face hit your fist, 2015 (30x50cm, Acrylic on paper) by Chi Loy Man</h3>
								</p>
							<h4>About the work:</h4>
							<p>“Conflicts may occur when people misunderstand each other. In my opinion, human rights involves understanding, respect and a sense of humour. We need to accept that each individual may think differently, and at the same time, we need to respect that distinction. A sense of humour is needed most when conflicts are ongoing and cannot be solved immediately”.</p>
							<h4>About the artist:</h4>
								<p>Chi Loy Man was born and raised in Hong Kong, but moved to the USA in the 1990s. He graduated with a BA in Studio Art from UC Davis and returned to Hong Kong in 1998.Chi Loy’s art statement is “Look for decent people in cramped environments and the future of ME”. He is curious as to how living spaces affect people’s thinking, having lived himself in vast areas in the USA and cramped spaces in Hong Kong. Website: https://www.pinterest.com/armechan/</p>

							<h3>Painted Robe (29.55x42cm) by Rachel Smith - senselessart
							</h3>
							<h4>About the work:</h4>
							<p>The piece is an art quality print of a watercolour painting. 
							</p>
							<h4>About the artist:</h4>
								<p>
									The first time I saw a Qing dynasty dragon robe in a travelling museum exhibition, I fell in love. The rulers clearly took advantage of the talents of their subjects and had them produce beautiful piece to clothe the emperor and his family. Painstaking goldwork shimmered on silks and in the centre of everything was the dragon. In many cases, every piece of available space was filled in with symbolic objects but my eye was always drawn back to the four toed dragon. As I lack skill with a needle, I decided to reproduce the luminosity of the thread with paint. This was one of the first and largest paintings I have done, a half life size reproduction of a black robe featuring 9 dragons. Website: https://www.senselessart.net/. Instagram: @senselessart
