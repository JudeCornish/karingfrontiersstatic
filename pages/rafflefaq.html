							<h3>Crossroads Simulation Experience</h3>
							<p>Two free spaces in our simulation programs, on the following understanding:</p>
							<p>Prize-winners can choose between our Blind X-perience and AIDS X-perience program or our Struggle for Survival program. Our Blind X-perience can also be booked with a blindness workshop for younger participants.
							</p>
							<p>As both simulations are group-based programs, the prize-winners would be invited to participate alongside a scheduled group and so would need to book according to availability.
							</p>
							<p>Prize winners can contact our team directly at this email address with a copy of the their prize ‘proof’ to start liaising on a booking. We’ll be glad to help them!

							<h4>Bio:
							</h4>
							<p>Crossroads Foundation (www.crossroads.org.hk) is a Hong Kong based, non-profit organisation serving global need. We believe that, in a broken world that sees too much suffering, we should do all we can to link those who are in need with those who can provide help. We, therefore, provide an intersection, literally a crossroads, to bring both together through four crossroads services:
							</p>
							<p>Global Distribution: This distributes Hong Kong's quality excess goods as needed, internationally and locally.</p>
							
							<p>Global Village: This offers simulated X-periences of global need.  
							</p>
							<p>Global Handicrafts: This sells fair trade goods from people in poverty.
							</p>
							<p>Global Hand: This provides a 'matching' website for public-private partnerships.

							<h3>Concrete Stories by Romain Jaquet-Lagrèze [Signed Copies] (x10)</h3>
							<h4>About Romain Jaquet-Lagrèze</h4>
							<p>Romain Jacquet-Lagrèze was born in Paris in 1987. He graduated with a Masters in Creative Media at the East Paris University. He moved to Hong Kong in 2009 and since 2010 he has been pointing his camera at Hong Kong to document the different aspects of his new home city.
							</p>
							<p>Stunned by the architectural race to the sky and the three dimensional character of Hong Kong, he published his first book with Asia One: ‘Vertical Horizon’ (p. 2012). The work was a hit on social media and soon after spread like wildfire over the internet world-wide and received attention from heavyweight local and international press.
							</p>
							<p>Motivated by the international bravo he continued to make new projects exploring Hong Kong’s unique landscape. Wild Concrete (p. 2014) depicts nature’s resilience in an urban environment. The Blue Moment (p. 2016) is a body of work exploring the duality of Hong Kong’s nature and urbanity during this magic hour at dusk. While Concrete Stories (p. 2018) collects a variety of human activities found on Hong Kong’s rooftops.
							</p>
							<p>Romain is still focusing on evolving his photography in Hong Kong where he resides and finds inspiration.

							<h3>Relics, Roots, and Ruins by Jayne Russell </h3>
							<p>After 18 years on Fleet St in London (inc The Sun, The News of the World, The People and magazines) and more prior working for the Australian Press, I am now based in the hub of Asia -HONG KONG.</p>
							<p>My time spent in London provided opportunities of working for newspapers and magazines from all around the world as well as travel to all corners of the world.
							</p>
							<p>Though News is my speciality I can bring varied experience to any job both on Location or in the Studio. You will get a professional result!
							</p>
							<p>With Hong Kong as the Hub of Asia, I can move quickly getting to a story sooner rather than later to secure your particular British / Australian/ American angle. Singapore, The Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam, Taiwan, China, and Brunei are only a matter of hours away.
