							<h3>Seeker, 2013 (60x60cm, Oil on Canvas) by Marc Standing</h3>
								<p>Estimated at $30,000-$40,000</p>
							<h4>About the artist:</h4>
								<p>Born in Zimbabwe in 1976, Marc obtained a Bachelor of Fine Arts Honors Degree from the University of Cape Town in South Africa. After emigrating to Australia in 2005, he is now currently based in Hong Kong. Marc has exhibited in New York, London, Holland, Hong Kong, South Africa and Zimbabwe, and has been included in prominent Australian art prizes, as well as being commissioned by The Groucho Club in London. He was also a nominee for the Sovereign Asian Art Prize and acquired by Artbank in Australia.</p>
							<h4>About 'Seeker':</h4>
								<p>“In ‘Seeker’, there is a play on the duality of what is hidden and what is apparent. On closer inspection, a masked figure penetrates the colourful array of birds, butterflies and orbs, which are reminiscent of natural organic forms. The hooded form represents a body silenced, confined, bound, and in a state of restraint. In juxtaposition, the birds become a symbol of freedom, flight and migration. Amongst these elements, the branches and lines in the painting morph into metaphorical topographies of our universe, perpetuating a presence of claustrophobia and entwinement. Overall the work can be interpreted as an allegory relating to human slavery, an act of aggression that at times occurs in front of our eyes without us even realising it.”</p>

							<h3>061 MAN, My face hit your fist, 2015 (30x50cm, Acrylic on paper) by Chi Loy Man</h3>
								<p>Estimated at $10,000-$15,000
								</p>
							<h4>About the work:</h4>
							<p>“Conflicts may occur when people misunderstand each other. In my opinion, human rights involves understanding, respect and a sense of humour. We need to accept that each individual may think differently, and at the same time, we need to respect that distinction. A sense of humour is needed most when conflicts are ongoing and cannot be solved immediately”.</p>
							<h4>About the artist:</h4>
								<p>Chi Loy Man was born and raised in Hong Kong, but moved to the USA in the 1990s. He graduated with a BA in Studio Art from UC Davis and returned to Hong Kong in 1998.Chi Loy’s art statement is “Look for decent people in cramped environments and the future of ME”. He is curious as to how living spaces affect people’s thinking, having lived himself in vast areas in the USA and cramped spaces in Hong Kong. Website: https://www.pinterest.com/armechan/</p>
