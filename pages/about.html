									<h3>[ Co-founder ]</h3>
									<h2>Cosima Lesca</h2>
								</div>
									<p>I spent a month abroad in Peru doing community service.The programme I was travelling with had ties to a school located in one of the more impoverished sectors of Peru. I spent my week there teaching english and building classrooms while having the opportunity to talk to some of the school's alumni. They shared how deeply grateful to the school they were for getting an education and of the work opportunities that followed thanks to having graduated. When my own school year started anew, I had a conversation with my friend Angelica who recounted her trip to Thailand and told me of her idea of supporting a school in the Mae Ra Moe refugee camp as a senior project. Hearing her passion as well as having seen first hand how beneficial an education can be, I told her I wanted to be a part of it. Fast forward to the present, I am immensely proud to say this is now far bigger than just a highschool idea. For the second year in a row, we have helped maintain the resources that these students need to empower themselves towards leadership and change within their community.

									<h3>[ Co-founder ]</h3>
									<h2>Angelica Cheng</h2>
								</div>
									<p>In 2018, I had a rare opportunity to visit an invisible and marginalized community: the Mae Ra Moe refugee camp. During my week there, I had a special chance to visit the Mae Ra Moe Junior College (MRMJC), where I heard dozens of these students’ dreams and aspirations. So many of them talked about wanting to make a difference. And I began to understand that for so many of them, this was their drive to keep on living, despite all the uncertainty and fear. But then I learned how the MRMJC was not going to be able to run that following year since their funding was about to run out. When I returned back home from this trip, I was unable to sit with the fact that the futures of 70 of the MRMJC students were in jeopardy. I wanted the Karen people to be seen. So I started talking as much as I could about the people I’ve met, the stories I’ve heard, and this urgent need to take action. Two amazing AMAZING friends of mine stepped up. And our restless energy for change manifested into the beginnings of Karing Frontiers. Since then, we’ve supported the school for two academic years, and we’re excited to continue empowering Karen youth through building access to education!

									<p>One of the qualities I have always admired and tried to imbibe is altruism. When Angelica came to me with her story of her visit to the Karen refugee camp, the forthcoming issues of the MRMJC, and how compelled she felt about finding a way to support the students. I immediately began to share the urge to take action. The three of us were aware that what we were venturing into a bigger and unfamiliar space, but we were determined to learn how we could be a part of the school’s mission to empower the MRMJC students. As three people who have been privileged with education, we felt that it was in our duty to help secure resources for these amazing students so they can continue to work towards a hope for a happier future. Supporting the students of the Mae Ra Moe Junior College has been an inspiring journey that I am grateful to be a part of.

										I found Karing Frontiers through my friend, a co-founder of the charity, Cosima. I was truly inspired and wanted to do whatever I could to help the cause alongside them. In the grand scheme of things, global charities raise considerably more than we do year on year. But its not about the grand scheme of things. The impact Karing Frontiers has on the 60 students at MRMJC is truly life-changing, not to mention the wider influence of those students as they grow and develop to grow their community further. I am very proud to be a part of that movement.

									<h2>What is my role as a Web Developer?</h2>
									<p>
										To aid the cause, I have developed the site you are viewing from scratch for free. I wanted there to be a clear and secure platform for people to make donations and to tell the story of the Karen people and what Karing Frontiers are doing to help them. 
									</p>
									<p>A key feature of the site is a completely custom payment flow with Stripe integration. It uses variable amounts and server side session generation. I did all of this and even paid for the hosting and domain of the site out of my own pocket, I'm truly 100% behind the cause.</p>
									<p>I am available for hire, please visit my website for more details: <a href="https://www.judecornish.co.uk" target="_blank">judecornish.co.uk</a></p>

									<h2>April Ieong</h2>
								</div>
									<p>
										My name is April, and I first learned about Karen refugees during a school trip in 2019. During that trip, I had a chance to visit the Mae Ra Moe refugee camp as well as teach at the MRMJC. After listening to students talk about their goals for the future, I became aware of how privileged I was to have education, and quickly developed a passion for the issue. Surprised by the lack of support Karen refugees received, I decided to join Karing Frontiers, and I hope that I can help build a better future for the Karen through providing education and raising awareness about the issue.

										I’m Aujin, and this issue sparked my interest because I’m invested in providing education to those in need. As someone who is privileged enough to receive education, I realised how important this privilege is to the Karen refugees for building their future.
