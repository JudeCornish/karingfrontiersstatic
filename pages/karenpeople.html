								Since 1984, Thailand has provided refuge to people fleeing
								violence in Myanmar, and more recently to economic migrants. The
								population in the Thai refugee camps, located along the
								Myanmar-Thailand border, is now estimated at 111,000 people.
								Some people were born in the camps and have never set foot
								outside.
							</p>
							<p>
								Most of the refugees in the nine camps are Karen people, an
								umbrella term that refers to a heterogeneous ethnic group
								without a shared language, culture or religion. Since the 1940s,
								ongoing violent conflicts between Karen separatists and the
								Burmese army have forced many families to move. Around 400,000
								Karen people are homeless.
							</p>
							<p>
								The living conditions in the camps are extremely poor. Drinking
								water is collected from wells and streams, and in the past,
								cases of cholera and malaria have occurred. Children suffer from
								chronic malnutrition and respiratory infections.

								Most of the camps are isolated in the mountains and therefore
								hard to access. There’s no electricity grid and some camps have
								no phone signal. Health care and education opportunities are
								extremely limited. In the rainy season, flash floods can cause
								damage to the infrastructure and even cause casualties.
							</p>
							<p>
								Other camps, such us Mae La Camp, the largest refugee camp with
								more than 40,000 refugees, are only an hour’s drive away from
								Mae Sot, the nearest town. More health service providers and
								schools are present, but the camps are overcrowded. The lack of
								space between the temporary houses, composed of bamboo and wood,
								has been the cause of many fires in the camp.

								The life of the refugees is quite restricted because they
								usually cannot go out, and the Thai police might arrest them if
								they do. So if adults want to earn some money, they have to do
								it secretly outside the camps, without getting caught. Most of
								the refugees don’t take that risk and stay inside the camp. They
								rely heavily on the weekly food distributions and the
								humanitarian assistance provided by international NGOs and
								community-based organisations, which makes them feel dependant
								and bored.
							</p>
							<p>
								Depression and alcohol addiction are very common amongst adult
								refugees, which puts their children at risk of neglect and
								malnutrition. No fewer than half of the adults suffer from
								mental health issues, which recently has lead to a rising number
								of suicides.
							</p>
							<p>
								This increase can partially be explained by rumours that
								refugees will have to return to Myanmar. As the peace process
								continues, both the Myanmar and the Thailand government, as well
								as the UNHCR encourage voluntary repatriation. But Karen
								refugees fear that the situation in their home country is not
								yet safe. Moreover, the idea of a ‘home country’ is for many a
								non-existent concept, since they were born in the camps. They
								have never known another way of living than their life in the
								camps. It’s the only reality they know.

								Almost half of the population of the Mae La camp is under 18.
								Most children are born in the camp; they don’t have birth
								certificates and are stateless, which jeopardizes their future.
							</p>
							<p>
								Besides difficult backgrounds, the poor living conditions, and
								an uncertain future, children lack the possibilities to learn
								and play.
							</p>
							<p>
								We hope to help this situation, specifically through the funding
								of the Mae Ra Moe Junior College (MRMJC).
