						<h2>Background:</h2>
						<p>
							Implementation of the Institute of Higher Education under the
							Karen Education Department (KED) was initiated in Mar NerPlaw, the
							Karen National Union Headquarters in 1982. The initial aim of the
							Institute was to provide high school graduates with an opportunity
							to further their education in specific fields of studies.
						</p>
						<p>
							The State Peace and Development Council’s (SPDC) and Democratic
							Karen Buddhist Army’s (DKBA) military activities in Karen State
							reached its peak in 1995, and as the results, thousands of
							civilian population moved to the Thai side of the Thailand-Burma
							border to take temporary refuge in different refugee camps,
							allowing them to set up their own education system. There are a
							total of seven Karen refugee camps located in Ratchburi province,
							Kanchanaburi province, Tak province, and Mae Hongson province
							respectively.
						</p>
						<p>
							As the number of high school graduates increased, community
							leaders and educational personnel realized that there was a need
							to set up post-ten schools or tertiary education programs in order
							to provide an opportunity for high school graduates to continue
							their studies in the camps. However, each post-ten school had its
							own aim and objectives according to the need of the community, and
							there were very limited cooperation and link between these
							programs.
						</p>
						<p>
							Therefore, with the intention of recognizing the efforts of these
							post-ten programs have made, the Institute of Higher Education,
							currently under the Karen Refugee Committee-Education Entity is
							initiating an action plan by promoting the existing post-ten
							programs and encouraging each to take initiative steps, extending
							their programming according to the needs and requirements of their
							communities.
						</p>
						<p>
							The Mae Ra Moe Junior College (MRMJC) the Mae Ra Moe Junior
							College was situated in Mae Ra Moe Karen Refugee Camp in Mae
							Hongson Province (Thailand).It was formerly known as the
							Agriculture Studies Programme (ASP) which was established in 1998
							in Mae Ra Moe refugee camp. At that time, the program’s emphasis
							was only on the teaching of agriculture and animal husbandry. In
							the academic year of 2003-2004, when school name was changed to
							Further Education Course (FEC), another stream of studies called
							Special Language Course (SLC) under the FEC was added. In 2008,
							when the school came under the IHE education system, the name was
							changed to Mae Ra Moe Junior College (MRMJC) and has utilized IHE
							curriculum and policies since then.
						</p>

						<h2>Future challenges & objectives:</h2>
						<p>
							MRMJC has been supported by Child's Dream Foundation from 2008 to
							2018.In the coming 2019 Academic year and in the days to come the
							Child's Dream Foundation is going to stop supporting MRMJC so it
							is a big problems for MRMJC to continue in the future.
						</p>
						<p>Current objectives:</p>
						<ol class="objectives-list">
							<li>
								To prepare leadership for all branches, organisations and
								departments in our communities.
							</li>
							<li>
								To adequately quality graduates for a position in recommended
								field area(s) in Karen Communities.
							</li>
							<li>
								To provide broad options in lifework through quality preparation

							</li>
							<li>To enable students to acquire high levels of knowledge.</li>
							<li>
								To promote critical analysis and testing of ideas and
								creativity.
							</li>
							<li>
								To assist students in developing their capacity to think and to
